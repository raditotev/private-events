# Private-Events Project

In this project we build app that allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations for parties. Events take place at a specific date and at a location.

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. This will require to model many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about foreign keys and class names.

This project is part of The Odin Project course on Ruby on Rails. For more information regarding this projects visit: http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/associations
